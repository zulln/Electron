# Merge Adjacent Lists plugin for Scribe

A plugin for [Scribe](https://github.com/guardian/scribe/) that joins adjacent lists (OL + OL or UL + UL) into one lists.

When you remove a list item in the middle of a list of 3 or more items the list will be split into two adjacent lists.

For example, removing item "3" in the numbered list "1, 2, 3, 4, 5" would turn it into two lists with the numbers "1, 2" and "1, 2".

So we need to merge adjacent lists so the count is correct for numbered lists, and the spacing between list items is correct for numbered and bullet lists.

The plugin is packaged as a AngularJS service and depends on the `scribe` module. See [scribe-angularjs](https://github.com/DigiExam/scribe-angularjs) for that module.
