The font file is generated using the IcoMoon tool and
the "IcoMoon - Free" icon pack.

https://icomoon.io/app/#/projects

The settings for the tool are saved in the "selection.json"
file next to the font file.

Import the settings file into the tool's project manager when
you need to make changes. You must import it as a new project
into the project manager, not just add it to an existing
project or else the font metric settings won't be imported.

Commit the updated settings file when you're done. Review
the changes and only commit the ones that makes sense so
it's easy to understand the history.
