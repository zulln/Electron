It is packaged as a AngularJS service and depends on the `scribe` module. See [scribe-angularjs](https://github.com/DigiExam/scribe-angularjs) for that module.

The options are set on the returned plugin instance so you can change them later if you need (for example change the word limit.)

| Option | Description |
| -----  | ----- |
| countCallback | (`Function`) Called when the count is updated. Arguments: `count` |
| limitCallback | (`Function`) Called when the limit is exceeded. Arguments: `count, limit` |
| hardWordLimit | (`Number`) If a change makes the count exceeds this number the change will be prevented. |
| wordBreakingTagsRegExp | (`RegExp`) Used to help the counting by finding tags that should break words so a word breaking character can be inserted at the end of them. |
